# gym-snake-rl

[Read my blog post about this repository here.](https://jfpettit.github.io/Introducing-gym-snake-rl/)

This package is intended to provide options for RL agents to play the game 'Snake' with single-agent and multi-agent options. Each of these options has various flavors with different sizes and quantities of food placed on the board. There is also an option to randomly generate maps throughout training so that your agent never sees the same map twice. 

Information about installation and further details about the code can be found at the blog post.
